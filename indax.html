            <p class="sectionsubTag text-small">Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the acquisition of
                knowledge, skills, values, morals, beliefs, habits, and personal development.[1] Education originated as
                transmission of cultural heritage from one generation to the next. Today, educational goals increasingly
                encompass new ideas such as liberation of learners, critical thinking about presented information,
                skills needed for the modern society, empathy and complex vocational skills. In China, Confucius (551â€“479 BCE), 
                of the State of Lu, was the country's most influential ancient
                philosopher, whose educational outlook continues to influence the societies of China and neighbours like
                Korea, Japan, and Vietnam. Confucius gathered disciples and searched in vain for a ruler who would adopt
                his ideals for good governance, but his Analects were written down by followers and have continued to
                influence education in East Asia into the modern era.[9].</p>

            <p class="sectionsubTag text-small"> Education designed to support early development in preparation for
                participation in school and society. The programmes are designed for children below the age of 3. This
                is ISCED level 01.[21] Preschools provide education from ages approximately three to seven, depending on
                the country when children enter primary education. The children now readily interact with their peers
                and the educator.[21] These are also known as nursery schools and as kindergarten, except in the US,
                where the term kindergarten refers to the earliest levels of primary education.[23]
                Kindergarten "provides a child-centred, preschool curriculum for three- to seven-year-old children that
                 aim[s] at unfolding the child's physical, intellectual, and moral nature with balanced emphasis on each 
                 of them."[24] This is ISCED level 02.[21]</p>

            <p class="sectionsubTag text-small">Education began in prehistory, as adults trained the young in the
                knowledge and skills deemed necessary in their society. In pre-literate societies, this was achieved
                orally and through imitation. Story-telling passed knowledge, values, and skills from one generation to
                the next. As cultures began to extend their knowledge beyond skills that could be readily learned
                through imitation, formal education developed. Schools existed in Egypt at the time of the Middle
                Kingdom.[6]


                Matteo Ricci (left) and Xu Guangqi (right) in the Chinese edition of Euclid's Elements published in 1607
                Plato founded the Academy in Athens, the first institution of higher learning in Europe.[7] The city of
                Alexandria in Egypt, established in 330 BCE, became the successor to Athens as the intellectual cradle
                of Ancient Greece. There, the great Library of Alexandria was built in the 3rd century BCE. European
                civilizations suffered a collapse of literacy and organization following the fall of Rome in CE 476.[8]
